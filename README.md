# Operating System Project

Welcome to the **Custom Operating System** project! This operating system is developed using **C** and **C++**, implementing core OS functionalities along with advanced memory management techniques. The project showcases various system commands, buffer management, memory handling, and error management.

## Features

### Commands
The operating system supports the following commands:
- **GD10**: [Get the data from the data card and put the data in the memory whose starting address is given in the instruction]
- **PD10**: [Print the data of the memory block whose address is given in the instruction]
- **BT04**: [Move to a specific instruction if toggle register is set]
- **CR10**: [Compare register content with memory content and store the data in the toggle register]
- **LR20**: [Load the data stored in the memory location specified in the instruction to general purpose register]
- **SR20**: [Store the data from the general purpose register to the memory whose address is specified in the instruction]
- **H**:  [Halt or terminate the program]

### Memory Management
- **Buffer Management**: Efficient handling of data transfer between memory and storage.
- **Paging**: Implements paging for memory allocation.
- **Page Table**: Manages mapping between logical and physical addresses.
- **Page Fault Handling**: Detects and resolves page faults efficiently.
- **Page Replacement Techniques**: Includes algorithms like FIFO, LRU, and Optimal Replacement.

### Error Handling
Robust error handling mechanisms ensure system stability and reliability.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- GCC Compiler for C/C++
