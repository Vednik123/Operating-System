# Operating System Project

Welcome to the **Custom Operating System** project! This operating system is developed using **C** and **C++**, implementing core OS functionalities along with advanced memory management techniques. The project showcases various system commands, buffer management, memory handling, and error management.

## Features

### Commands
The operating system supports the following commands:
- **PD**: [Description of PD command]
- **GD**: [Description of GD command]
- **BT**: [Description of BT command]
- **CM**: [Description of CM command]

### Memory Management
- **Buffer Management**: Efficient handling of data transfer between memory and storage.
- **Paging**: Implements paging for memory allocation.
- **Page Table**: Manages mapping between logical and physical addresses.
- **Page Fault Handling**: Detects and resolves page faults efficiently.
- **Page Replacement Techniques**: Includes algorithms like FIFO, LRU, and Optimal Replacement.

### Error Handling
Robust error handling mechanisms ensure system stability and reliability.

## Concepts Used
1. **Buffer Management**: Handles temporary data storage during I/O operations.
2. **Paging**: Divides memory into fixed-size pages to optimize space utilization.
3. **Page Table**: Maps virtual addresses to physical memory locations.
4. **Page Fault**: Manages situations where required pages are not in memory.
5. **Page Replacement Techniques**:
   - **FIFO** (First In, First Out)
   - **LRU** (Least Recently Used)
   - **Optimal Replacement**

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- GCC Compiler for C/C++
- Basic understanding of Operating System concepts

## Usage
Execute commands within the OS shell to perform various operations. For example:
```bash
PD
GD
BT
CM
```
